# Autocomplete

Beat the Autocomplete: A game where the user competes against the autocomplete AI to complete an incomplete sentence.

The autocomplete system is implemented using a Hidden Markov Model and a bidirectional approach to guess the missing word(s) in a sentence. The user interface was built using Tkinter for multiple modes of the game, and added features to provide hints and customize difficulty.
